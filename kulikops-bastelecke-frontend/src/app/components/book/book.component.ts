        { type: 'text', content: "Sinja gifted me a day togerther, for my 19. Birthday. Back then we were still together. We both knew that we possible won't be a couple anymore on my birthday, but we agreed to spend this day together no matter what. We went to Zürich today. When we arrived, the first thing we did, was eating Pho at Pho Na. It was good. 8/10. I bought a new Jacket, a dark turquoise Daunenjacke, which my parents gifted me for Birthday. After this we searched for the real Photoautomat and landed in a Christmas market. It was cute as hell and everything seemed so alterna tive and left oriented. We found a cute silent corner with a couple of benches and sat down. We leaned our heads onto each other. We probably discussed about our future, I don't exactly remember. I remember that I told her, we an't stay like this forever. We have to stop at some point. She said: \"Or get back together\". My conclusion of the discussion was, that it would not matter if we continued today or not, so we continued. We kissed. I didn't even question it a lot, like last time we did this.So basically, the rest of the day we were kind of a couple again. We kissed, held hands, and so on. After we had a look at clothes in the Heilsarmee Brocki next to the market, we went to the real Photoautomat. Sinja planned to go there and really wanted to take pictures. There were people waiting, and I randomly became an introvert, so I didn't want to go anymore. Sinja was able to überzeugen mich to do it anyways, which was cool. After we took the pictures, we found out it really took analog pictures which took 6 minutes to print. We were not prepared to take the first two pictures, this dumb photoautomat just started taking pictures. The other ones are looking good. It was already late so we took the train back to Olten and went to Sinjas house. She wanted to watch titanic with me. This is about the first thing Sinja wanted to do with me, after we came together. Maybe even before. During the whole year, from time to time Sinja told me: \"Ooh we finally need to watch Titanic together\"."},

We heard Livia talking to someone in the living room, which made Sinja really happy. \"OMG, Liviadidn't have friends for four years\", she whispered to me, and laughed."},

I listened to the titanic music and started thinging about all the beautiful things, me and Sinja did together, all the fun time we spent. But also I was thinking about how our relationship  will develop in the future. She asked me for a kiss, with a bit of hesitation we kissed. After a few minutes, Sinja asked me: \"What are you thinking about?\". She asks that from time to time and I usually don't really know what to answer. \"About us. And what will become of us\".I suddenly remembered every moment we spent together. Like in a flip-book, i saw my memories in front of my eyes. I felt a tear in my eyes, and I heard, that Sinja also started crying a little. Should we get back together? Or completely end the kind of relationship were having?"},

Because I know that she wants to get back together with me. \"I know\". I was thinking about how beautiful it would be if this was the last day of us having a romantic relation, because it was a really beautiful day, and a good way to end it. Also, we finally watched Titanic. The thing, she wanted to do since last year. This thought started a chain reaction that brought me to where I am now. Back then, I just didn't realize it. I sat up. And then, I saw something. There was a picture on the wall, that I had never seen before. On the picture is an old red clock, standing on a wet road, showing the time 11:55. Füf vor zwölfi. Next to the clock was a text. And this text brought me to where I am now. It said \"Time for change\"."},

I realized there also was a second hand. It displayed exactly 20 seconds. So tecnically it didnt show \"Füf vor Zwölfi\", but 4:20 before twelfe. Thats why I replied to her question, with a dead serious voice: \"Smoke a joint\". She was really confused and told me not to, which I found quite amusing. Time for change. Like in a fewer dream, I couldn't get this quote out of my mind, I couldn't think of anything else. I started believing, maybe this was the way to go. Change. And change means, totally stopping my relationship with her. Sinja wanted to cuddle, so we cuddled. I just couldn't get my view off this damn picture. I probably stared at it for at least ten minutes. And then, Sinja asked me for a kiss. A kiss, that she would not get. And she recieved almost every single kiss she ever requested. \"I don't feel like it. I'm just not quite in the mood now.\". I said this, while looking at the picture. Time for change."},
        { type: 'text', content: "\"Should I stop?\" She meant stopping, to ask for kisses. Not only this, but also stopping with cuddling, stopping everything. Just stop. I somehow felt, that she meant everything, even tho she never said that.\nI didn't know wether I wanted it to stop or not. In a short time perspective, I just wanted to have fun and be happy, so just to continue. However on a long time perspective it would probably make more sence to stop. So I said \"I don't know\". But I continued thinking. Though, I didn't find a better answer. Maybe I wanted it to stop. I didn't think about what consequences it will have. So I said: \"Velech scho\"."},
        { type: 'text', content: "I should have thought more about saying this. I just let it out. It was something that would usually be on your mind, but you don't say. It was an option that I had among others. What brought me to saying it, I don't know. That was quite spontanious."},

Everytime I fount time, I probably wasted it on social media. I am currently writing in the web editor of github on my phone, which is cursed. Here are a few things that happemed since last time we saw us: I started learning italian on duilingo, and i really enjoy it ao far. I bouldered 2 7b+ (one of them is a 6c+ in my and Thomas opinion), the other one was actually fkn hard. After the stuff with sinja stopped, things changed. We barely write together and never met , except in Jubla. I think its the smartest thing to do. I'm quite sure sinja didnt get over me yet, but I'll see. I'm looking forwars to discuss thi gs out at some point, and clear things up. I noticed something in the last few weeks. I miss havi g a girmfriend. Especially i want to cuddle aomething at night, for now I'm using orca. Also I feel like I get a crush(whatever that means) on everyone i meet. Like forreal. Examples are, Gabriele (lithuanian friend of thomas), Aline (climbing buddy) and Muriel (jonas friend he, he brought her bouldering a few times). That must be happening because of my urge to have a girlfriend again. Like i reeeally wanna get to know muriel right now. Because ahes the one of the three i met the last lol. And I know her the least. She can climb some 6a's abd 6b's. Got long, really really bright blond hair, is about as big as me and as skinny as me (except my crazy V shape cap)"},

Like the fuck, Leander told me stuff and showed me stuff I didn't know about. I will try to make a summary of what he told me. Sinja and Leander talked together, after me and her got together. Sinja explained to Leander, that she kind of had feelings for both him and me, at the time when me and her got together. That was already quite weird, like she had the decision of who to take and when I showed up she just accepted that... I don't get it really. After being together with me for 5 months with me, she shouldn't give a single fuck about Leanders feelings for other people, right? I mean she is not supposed to have feelings for him at this point. Well, when Leander came together with Gianna, he told that to Sinja when they walked home together once. As far as I understood it right, Sinja couldn't handle this and got sad... She didn't want Leander to have someone else. Thats weird. Especially because Leander having feelings for Sinja destroyed our whole frinedship. Like when Leander told me he got a girlfriend, I was so happy for him! Also for me, because I thought he was finally done with Sinja. So I really can't understand why in the world she would get jealous of this guy. Leander showed me texts from Sinja where se said stuff like that she had feelings for him and still likes him?? Thats what I have in mind, she didn't say it exactly like this but that's the meaning that I understood from it."},

The day we broke up, Leander was invited to Sinja by Alena, but he declined to go there if not Sinja directly asked him. Well, she did, they made out. Sinja, why the fuck? Do you have feelings for Leander? If so, why didn't you ever talk to me? In some way? I would love to hear her opinion about this stuff but I doubt that it's a good idea to talk about everything already. I probably should wait a bit until the whole situation cools down."},

I usually don't write people I don't know, so this was quite special for me, I guess. Everyone else got sick or is hurt. Thomas got a destroyed finger and knee, I hope it's alright for when we go to Italy. About this, lea successfully did her driving test, so Thomas doesn't have to drive alone. But Lea never drove with a Handgeschalted car before haha so this is going to be a lot of fun! A thing do all the time, is some kind of hoping that someone is watching me, or seeing what I see. Then they see how cool I am. For examle, when I went biking once in 7. Grade, I wished, Frau Frey would see me right now to see how fkn cool I am. I had this with basically everyone, and today it was Muriel. Fuck dude, I don't even know her!"},

I haven't done anything the whole day, and that makes me feel like shit. I slept until noon, still missed the lunch somehow, and then I scrolled through social media the whole afternoon. I asked Celine if she was around to do something, but she was away. I'll probably meet her after dinner or for dinner, though. I have a big fucking problem. I broke my right little finger last Friday. Every time someone asks me how I managed to do this, I have to laugh, because it's so fucking stupid. We played a ball game called \"Bodedüpfis\" or \"Sitzball\". I was standing in a corner, one of our kiddos (I think Valentin, but not too sure) threw a ball at me. As a self defending kind of move, I lifted my left knee and kicked into my right hand. Yep, I broke it completely myself. I'm going to finale ligure for climbing the whole next week which is fucking dumb lol. I went bouldering yesterday, and I managed to climb a few routs without the finger hurting, so I'll be alright next week. We planned to go a day earlier than we planned and go to a party in Milano or something. Now, spontaneously Lea and Especially Till doesn't want to go anymore. They could at least have told us earlier. It would have been way too cool, in my opinion. Whatever. As I said, today I feel like shit. I never had planned as few as in the current holidays. Especially with a broken finger, I can't do shit. Since I started writing here, I feel better, also because of the German banger songs I'm blasting through my room right now.

I wanna get to know her better. She's cute as hell! And then there's Sinja. I am not at all interested in her anymore. We barely talk and never met except in jubla, since our breakup. Somehow I'm a bit jealous, whoch also botheres me. I know she stressed away after jubla sitzung yesterday and went to Jens, pretty sure she slept there. Made me jealous, I really don't want that. But a reason for it is probably, that Sinja and Jens had something together roughly two weeks before the end of our relationship, even tho nobody knows what it was. I'd be really interested, and I want to talk to her. I don't know if its a good Idea, and I dont want to ask her to talk. Yea, life sux.

She said why not, and we went to Lenzburg. That was fun. She's sooo cool! Even as I asked her I already excpected that she wouldn't come, also because it was quite late already so not 100% worth it... Yea I think I learned my lesson. Take a chance or lose it. I took it.

Next thing I remember, we're standing in the kitchen. Me next to Muriel. It's dark outside, it's nighttime. There are other people in the kitchen. I don't know who it was. They just stood there. Everything was very calm. It was like it was in slow motion. Then, Muriel leaned her head against my shoulder. I took a step closer to her, and for a while we both stood there, side to side. I leaned my head against hers, our bodies toching each others. and then, then we kissed. It was very soft and shy, only once and short, we looked at each other and then kissed again"},

Mer si zum Zug gloffe, dä isch 23.13 gharen, ond hend alli erwartet, das mer sitzplätz het wo me cha abeklappe ond chli liggey oder immerhin halbwägs.

In frankfurt am Main simmer usgstige, dasch um di drüü gsi, ond hei chli früschi luft gschnappt. De lele het natürlech no eis müsse rauche, zom weder fit sii. Det hemmer de no en lustigi konversation mit em bsoffnige gha, er het chli sini Läbensfilosi verzellt. Eine het geld welle für es ticket, das het em aber gloub niemer welle gä. Joo, de hei mer müsse am sächsi am Morge umstiige in Köln, e be churz met em Marc go de Dom aaluege, ond s hei sech öppe aui es Kavj kauft. Aso es isch jetzt grad in Wesel no en zwöite Bus cho, drumm hemmer jz chli me platz ond e cha im Gang am Rucksack aalehne ond d Bei strecke😍aso scho mol öppis! Uf jede fall hani mi vorher entschide das das jzt s ultimative 5-Tages-Tagebuech für d Jael werd, aso heyy jaellll💛😂 Also, mittwuch nacht: mer sind denn nach em umstiige öppe am Nüni in Amsterdam aacho, ond sind afe mol is Hostel gloffe, mer hei müsse d fähri nää übere grossi Kanal, wells kei Brugg het haha. De hei mer zum grosse glück grad scho chönne iichecke ond hei üsi Zimmer iigrichtet. Es sind so viererzimmer gsi mit duschi ond wc, aber seife ond handtüecher hets leider nid gha :( whatever...ner simmer (öppe Leander, Joelle, Niklas, Luca, Raffi, Anouk, celine, sophie, svenja) glii mol ind stadt gloffe ond hei chli erkundigt, was es alles so git, in amsterdam. Boah e ha grad afo musig lose mit mouce cancelling, ond s isch so schöön, welli e ganzi wuche ned MINI musig ha chönne lose, sondern nur das fo anderne haha. Aso sorry: mer sind chli umegloffe, hei nöime spagetti gässe, ond si zerst us versehe no churz dür s rotliechtviertel gloffe, wo (am 11 am Morge) fraue in bikinis i de Schaifänster gstande sind, wie bimene chleider lade, dasch eifach so krass gsii...irgendwie au relativ verstörend, hani gfunde. Nochdem simmer nöime i nes café ghocket ond hend es kafi trunke. Irgendwenn sind no de luca, d Jo ond de Yves derzuegstosse. Di meiste sind denn in en Coffe shop gange, das sind ebe di einzige orte wo me legal gras cha chaufe ond konsumiere. Leander, Jo, Luca ond tarec sind de aber ned gange (vo dene si au noni alli gnue alt) ond mer si spscht chli ume gachlenderet. Mer hei abgacht met de andere am vieri bim Dungeon...gfürchigi sach! Det simmer de au häre ond eigentlech ischs wie de geister parkour wo mer amigs im lager mache aber chli di krasser version, s isch öppe 45 minute gange ond mer sind dür verschideni rüüm gschickt worde wo irgendöppis verzellt worde isch oder mer eifach verschreckt worde sind haha, uf jede fall hegs no spass gmacht! Aaschliessend hemmer en obligatorische treffpunkt gha zum mit allne zäme Burger esse zum Znacht. A üsem tisch hets eifach en Bier-Zapfhahne gha ond mer hend sälber chönne üses eigene Bier zapfe, das hani no nie gseh😂mer heis zerst überhaupt ned im griff gha ond s het nume schuum gä, ups XD Nach em Znacht simmer i üsem Hostel id Bar gange im chäller, s het mega billigi drinks gä döte, de hemmrr chli en gmüetleche oobe gha ond no es blöds chartespeli gspillt. Zum de Oobe lo usklinge beni no mit em Leander, de Jo ond em Luca go spaziere, denn simmer relativ früe ins bettli, zom chli schloof ufhole vo de Zugfahrt-Nacht am tag vorher."},

S Fabrique des lumieres isch so wie es Museum, fo dete hani der au en snap gschickt, jael. Es isch eigentlech ganz en grossi Halle wo mega läär isch, s het aber ganz vell Lüüt gha wo überall umeghocket ond umegstande sind. Es hett so gigantischi Beamer wo eifach die kompletti halle belüchte ond denne lauft eigentlech so es video, met mega krasse illusione ond animatione ond so, eifach s ganze gebäude eigenltech. Dasch sehr lustig gsi, ond eifach beiidruckend wells so di ganz want bewegt het haha. Joo, uf jede fall simmer denne velecht nach einehalb stund weder gange, vis à vis hets es streetfood festival gha, denne simmer döte nöime öppis go trinke ond hei no chli öppis gässe. Die andere hei det churros gno, ond si si immer no de feste überzüügig, das das die beste Churros sind gsi wo existiere haah. S het imfall eifach en lade gha wo \"milf\" gheisse het, ond weisch für was isch es gstande? Man, I love Fish. Also come on, wenn das nid extra so gmacht worde isch, denne weissi eifach au ned hahaha, aber jo dasch funny gsii. Denne hei mer üüs uf e rückweg ins hostel gmacht ond hei unterwegs nöime no en billigi glace gschnauset, so es grosses cornet mit chugele, für nume 1.90! scho crazy, wie billig alles isch, im Usland. E han denn eigentlech gar kei znacht möge esse, welli zum zmittag scho 2 salamisandwich gässe ha, ond denne no vill z vill vo denne fries haha, die si ebe scho no  fein gsi. S esch de übrigens mittlerwiile 2 i de Nacht, e be vorher hei choo ond ha dänkt e schriibe no chli wiiter a däm. es zieht sech ebe, e muess me schriibe alsi ha erwartet😅aber do beni au chli sälber t schuld. E mache de morn homeoffice, de chani no chli länger schloofe ond mache ned ganz so vill Minusstunde wie süscht immer, lol. Auso, de fritig. E ha glaub gar nüt znacht gha, aber uf jede Fall hei mer im Hostel denne es Beer pong gspillt, eg und de Marc hend gege d Joelle ond de Niklas gwunneee, juhuu, do beni scho chli stolz gsi. En pitcher zum gläser fülle het nume 10.- kostet, obwohl det irgendwie 1.6 liter bier dinne isch. verstohni immer noni ganz, well en halbe liiter het mindistens 5 kostet. ergendöppis esch ned ganz ufgange. Nochdem mer gwnne hei simmer denn no id stadt gangen öppis go esse, mer si eeeewigkeite umegirrt, äuä öppe sibe mol im kreis, well di einte eifach unbedingt pommes hend welle ha. De einti lade wo mer häre sind het denne scho zue gha ond mer hei no di halbi grupppe verlore....irgendwenn simmer denne aber i Wok to walk gange, en mega geile wok takeaway, wie s wokami wo mer do hei.

Eigentlech hemmer nächär alli zäme i ne club welle go, go party mache, ond mer sind zu eim gange neb em hostel aber denne het sech use gstellt, das de eifach erst ab 21 isch gsi...also de leander, marc ond ech sind gar ned erst ine cho...mer hei üs öppis ztrinke gno ond si i de hostel lounge uf nes sofa gläge ond hei kiss marry kill gspillt :) ond de simmer au irgendwie zu humane ziite weder zrügg is zimmer go pfuuse. am halbi drüü sind denne d joelle und svenja ins zimmer zrügg cho, ond oooh min gott isch d joelle betrunke gsi, halleluja!

        { type: 'text', content: "Oke s isch jz scho Zistig, ha gester nid möge wiiter schriibe haha, sorry :) Oke, mer mache Wiiter mit em Samstig: Am Samstig morge hei mer alli chli länger gschlofe als mer eigentlech hätte welle, e glaub mer sind so am halbi zwölfi oder so ufgwachet, de simmer alli go dusche ond hännd üs früsch gmacht für e Tag. De simmer id Stadt gfahre, (mer hei jedes mol müsse die Fähri nä, dasch ächt lustig gsi) ond hei üs öppis Zmittag gsuecht. Mer si denne wider zum Wok to walk gange haha, E ha denne aber nid scho weder möge wok ässe, dromm hani mer Süsskartoffel pommes gholt, grad näbe draa. die sind echt mega mega nice gsi, aber i ha irgendwenn nümme möge fertig ässe, di andere heis no müsse ufesse xd. Für necher wäri eigentlech de plan gsi, das mer alli zäme göi go velos miete ond chli ome cruise ond denne nöime göi i ne park go härehöckle ond chille. Zerst beni de aber met em leander ond em severin chli go secondhand vintage lädeli abklappere. Denne hei di andere i chat gschribe, das s velofahre abgseit wird :( hani recht schad gfunde, wells so wie s einzige grosse ding wär gsi, wo mer alli 19 zäme gmacht hätte....jaa chli schad gsi. de hei mer no gluegt öb me cha go böötli fahre uf de kanäl, aber es sind alli böötli scho usbuechet gsi, dromm simmer no meh vintage lädeli go abklappere ond e ha mer es summer-hömmli kauft ond mer alli drüü en ganz lustigi sunnebrülle XD si isch mega breit ond nur so 1cm höch, am leander sini so komplett s gägeteil. De simmer nöime es kafi go nä, domit mer ufs wc chöi, ond dete hani en riise schock becho welli zerst gmeint ha es het keis wc papier meh...zum glück hets hinter mir no es paar rolle gha, aso ha no chhönne putze🤪De ischs scho relativ spot gsi ond mer si zrügg zum hostel gschlenderet. De hani no en 10 minute Powernap gmacht, ond mer sind use gange, a Fluss, ond hend üs z dritte je es browni gschnouset...S isch echt fein gsi, schön füecht, ond mit somene liechte cannabis nachgschmack. De simmer weder uf d Fähri gange, hend üs öppis z trinke kauft am Bahnhof, ond sind ine Park gloffe damit mer döt chli chöi go chlille, wenn me denne s brownie so richtig gspürt haha, die würke ebe erst so nach 45 Minute oder nachere stund so richtig. Jo mer sind recht lang gloffe well mer ned checkt hend das de park sooo wiit wäg isch xd de simmer döte uf es bänkli ghocket ond hei chli schwätzt. S timing isch perfekt gsi, well genau denne simmer so richtig ricthig high worde😂Aso i bi no nie high gsi, ond e muss säge es isch scho no lustig. Also i probiers der z beschriibe: So mini ufnamefähigkeit isch eifach praktisch uf null gsii, so d sache wo me aaluegt checkt me nid richtig. E ha alli 10 sekunde vergesse über was mer vor 10 Sekunde diskutiert heit. Wenni öppis aagluegt ha ischs mega im fokus gläge ond alles andere rundume hani eifach usbländet. Es isch eifach alles lustig gsi wo me gseh het, i ha mi würklech müsse zrügghebe, dasi ned eifach e stund lang glachet ha😂E be scho nume verreckt wellis lustig gfunde ha, dasi jetzt alles so lustig finde hahaha, ond jo mer hei denne äuä so en stund übere grösst schissdräck diskutiert, imfall würklech abnormals züg. Aso jo, s isch rechtig rechtig lustig gsi. Das ztrinke woni mer vorher am bahnhof kauft ha het so en alu-schrubdeckel gha, ond au so es aluringli unter em deckel. de hani halt welle das ufschruube ond das aluringli het mer total i finger gschnitte lol, s het afemol zemli blüetet denne. Irgendöpper fo de andere het mer de es pflaster gä, aber jo wie dasi mi döt gschnitte ha isch, ond bliibt es riisigs Mysterium. Irgendwenn hei mer üs denn entschide, das mer chli umelaufe zum es wc sueche welli echt dringend ha müsse go. de het de Leander gseit das er muess chötzle, ond de simmer ewigs ume gstande ond hend gwartet, aber de leander het de doch nid müsse chötzle, aber s isch em echt nid guet gange. De simmer no chli wiiter ume gloffe ond e ha zerst mega lang s gfühl gha, dasi immer nume no meh high wirde, aber irgendwenn hani checkt das es mer glaub doch au ned so guet goht😂Aso i bi denn a de punkt cho woni ganz churz devor gsi bi, in ohnmacht gheie, also i ha nümm chönne sto ond be so halb zämebroche ond abghocket🙈S isch de aber zum glück es bizeli gange, ond irgend so en jungi frau wo verbii gloffe isch het üs mega nett gholfe ond im coffe shop nebe draa es All-Activity-Drink gholt, offebar passiert das ebe no em einte oder andere wenn me z vill raucht oder so, dromm kenne die das ond wüsse au so chli was mache, ond das het eifach ganz vill zucker dinne ond de sötts eim e chli besser goo. Mer sind denne necher au no selber i de coffe shop gange ond sind ufs wc ond hei üs nomol so en AA-Drink gholt, de hei mer üüs gwagt zrügg zum Hostel z laufe, was zemli scetcky gsi isch well mer voll dür d stadt gloffe sind ond die ville lüüt hend mer nid grad besser too, aber mer heis gschafft, so inere halbstund oder so😂Im hostel hemmer de leander abglade ond e be no füf minute abgläge, ond de severin het unbedingt zu de andere lüüt id stadt welle go znacht esse ond e be mer gar ned sicher gsii,  öbs mir gnueg guet goht zom mitgoo, aber e be denne doch gange (zum glück) ond sobald i us em hostel dusse be gsii hani gmerkt, das es mer grad villll besser goht, aso e be nümme würkli high gsi ond nümm so schwindelig, aso weder halbwegs fit. also, denn simmer id stadt gange di andere go sueche, denne isch glaub öppe nüni am oobe gsi. Di andere sind im Rotliecht-Viertel gsi, mer hend denne es paari gfunde imene coffee shop am kiffe. De hei mer no chli passiv-kifft ond sind necher di andere go sueche."},
