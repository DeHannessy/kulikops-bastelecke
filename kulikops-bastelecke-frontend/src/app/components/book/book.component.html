  <h1>Velech scho</h1>
  <p>
    I just rubbed my eyes like never before. I knew the day would come. I'm sitting in my room, it's 23:54. Almost time, I just realized. Time to change. Now. I changed. 26.11.2022, 23:55:20.
  </p>
  <p>
    I really really don't know if this was a good decicion, a bad decicion or both. I definitely changed my life. S esch füf for zwölfi. I take a deep breath and feel the bumpiness of the breath, because I just stopped crying. Quite an interesting thing that I'm doing here. Is it just my typing routine? Me having fun of programming? Or am I actually writing a book, even if it's quite a small one? I don't know. But I'm writing it in Visual Studio Code, in the book.component.html file on kulikops-bastelecke website. Random, right?
  </p>
  <p>
    Anyways, I should start telling the story now. The first thing I'll write, is the end.
  </p>

  <h2>The end</h2>
  <p>Sinja gifted me a day togerther, for my 19. Birthday. Back then we were still together. We both knew that we possible won't be a couple anymore on my birthday, but we agreed to spend this day together no matter what. We went to Zürich today. When we arrived, the first thing we did, was eating Pho at Pho Na. It was good. 8/10. I bought a new Jacket, a dark turquoise Daunenjacke, which my parents gifted me for Birthday. After this we searched for the real Photoautomat and landed in a Christmas market. It was cute as hell and everything seemed so alterna tive and left oriented. We found a cute silent corner with a couple of benches and sat down. We leaned our heads onto each other. We probably discussed about our future, I don't exactly remember. I remember that I told her, we an't stay like this forever. We have to stop at some point. She said: "Or get back together". My conclusion of the discussion was, that it would not matter if we continued today or not, so we continued. We kissed. I didn't even question it a lot, like last time we did this.So basically, the rest of the day we were kind of a couple again. We kissed, held hands, and so on. After we had a look at clothes in the Heilsarmee Brocki next to the market, we went to the real Photoautomat. Sinja planned to go there and really wanted to take pictures. There were people waiting, and I randomly became an introvert, so I didn't want to go anymore. Sinja was able to überzeugen mich to do it anyways, which was cool. After we took the pictures, we found out it really took analog pictures which took 6 minutes to print. We were not prepared to take the first two pictures, this dumb photoautomat just started taking pictures. The other ones are looking good. It was already late so we took the train back to Olten and went to Sinjas house. She wanted to watch titanic with me. This is about the first thing Sinja wanted to do with me, after we came together. Maybe even before. During the whole year, from time to time Sinja told me: "Ooh we finally need to watch Titanic together".
    <span class="thought" *ngIf="showThoughts">
      Pretty fucking sad
      it ended with the thing she wanted to do first. Somehow pretty fucking beautiful. Actually one of the reasons for me to write this, because its some serious Drama content.
    </span>
  </p>

  <p>
    So we arrived at Sinjas house. She ringed the bell because she was tired of opening the app, whilst I locked my red Bycicle. Livia opened the door and let us in. I put of my shoes and hung up my new, dark turquoise Daunen Jacket. First, I formed a ball of it, like I did an hour ago, just to get impressed by how small and light it is. We heard Livia talking to someone in the living room, which made Sinja really happy. "OMG, Liviadidn't have friends for four years", she whispered to me, and laughed.
    <span class="thought" *ngIf="showThoughts">
      At this point, I want to make a new menu Icon on the website for this book. All the time i spent on this website, I wondered what I'm going to do with it, what I'm going to program on it. It was all for this book. I'm feeling like I'm loosing all my emotions by writing everything down, I forgot how I should be feeling. Also I'm not in the  flow anymore but I'll try to continue. After a 10fastfingers test. 80 WPM.
    </span>
    We walked past the living room, into the small TV Room with a couch. Sinja put two packs of Microwave Popcorn into the microwave and gave one to Livia and her friend. I sat on the couch, Sinja next to me. She pressed
    the play button. We kissed again. "Am I allowed to give you mini spoilers?", asked smiling Sinja, but since I would find out everything quite soon, I said no.
    <span class="private" *ngIf="showPrivateStuff">
      About halfways through the movie, we started to get horny. No we didn't, we were horny the whole day. But at least that was when we started acting horny.
    </span>
    <span class="thought" *ngIf="showThoughts">
      Unfortunately, I just scrolled through instagram reels for half an hour, and forgot everything that happened this evening. I still want to write down that shit today because afterwards I will forget even more. So the solution to this, is eating/drinking a bowl of buillon so thats what I'm going to do now. - I'm back. The three best things I know, are soup, salami and climbing. Thats why I ate bouillon, salami and took a shortsession on my hangboard.
    </span>
    <span class="private" *ngIf="showPrivateStuff">
      <span class="thought" *ngIf="showThoughts">Now this is boutta get hella private and I don't feel too comfortable about that... However probably noone is going to read this so I don't really care.</span>
      We started to make out, while there were people falling off titanic.
      <span class="thought" *ngIf="showThoughts">I really do feel uncomfortable now. Edit of 14.12.2022. Bruh that was cringe af i deleted it sry</span>
    </span>
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 30px;">[...]</p>
  <p>
    The movie finished and the credits flew over the screen. I looked at Sinjas face, she was crying. We both knew she was going to cry before we started watching. "I'm sorry, I'm just too emotional", she said. We liednext to each other on the couch. I listened to the titanic music and started thinging about all the beautiful things, me and Sinja did together, all the fun time we spent. But also I was thinking about how our relationship  will develop in the future. She asked me for a kiss, with a bit of hesitation we kissed. After a few minutes, Sinja asked me: "What are you thinking about?". She asks that from time to time and I usually don't really know what to answer. "About us. And what will become of us".I suddenly remembered every moment we spent together. Like in a flip-book, i saw my memories in front of my eyes. I felt a tear in my eyes, and I heard, that Sinja also started crying a little. Should we get back together? Or completely end the kind of relationship were having?
    <span class="thought" *ngIf="showThoughts">Holy crap, its already 02:38. I've been writing for almost 3 hours by now. The guild round already ended.</span>
    Or just leave everything as it is now? I didn't want to leave it like it is now. I didn't know what to do. Sinja told me, its basically on me to decide. Because I know that she wants to get back together with me. "I know". I was thinking about how beautiful it would be if this was the last day of us having a romantic relation, because it was a really beautiful day, and a good way to end it. Also, we finally watched Titanic. The thing, she wanted to do since last year. This thought started a chain reaction that brought me to where I am now. Back then, I just didn't realize it. I sat up. And then, I saw something. There was a picture on the wall, that I had never seen before. On the picture is an old red clock, standing on a wet road, showing the time 11:55. Füf vor zwölfi. Next to the clock was a text. And this text brought me to where I am now. It said "Time for change".
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 30px;">[...]</span>
    Sinja asked me if I'm gonna sleep at hers
  </p>

  <p>
    "What do we do now?" asked Sinja and made a sad face. I didn't reply for a while. I looked at the picture again and thought about it. I realized there also was a second hand. It displayed exactly 20 seconds. So tecnically it didnt show "Füf vor Zwölfi", but 4:20 before twelfe. Thats why I replied to her question, with a dead serious voice: "Smoke a joint". She was really confused and told me not to, which I found quite amusing. Time for change. Like in a fewer dream, I couldn't get this quote out of my mind, I couldn't think of anything else. I started believing, maybe this was the way to go. Change. And change means, totally stopping my relationship with her. Sinja wanted to cuddle, so we cuddled. I just couldn't get my view off this damn picture. I probably stared at it for at least ten minutes. And then, Sinja asked me for a kiss. A kiss, that she would not get. And she recieved almost every single kiss she ever requested. "I don't feel like it. I'm just not quite in the mood now.". I said this, while looking at the picture. Time for change.
  </p>
  <p>
    "Should I stop?" She meant stopping, to ask for kisses. Not only this, but also stopping with cuddling, stopping everything. Just stop. I somehow felt, that she meant everything, even tho she never said that.<br>
    I didn't know wether I wanted it to stop or not. In a short time perspective, I just wanted to have fun and be happy, so just to continue. However on a long time perspective it would probably make more sence to stop. So I said "I don't know". But I continued thinking. Though, I didn't find a better answer. Maybe I wanted it to stop. I didn't think about what consequences it will have. So I said: "Velech scho".
  </p>
  <p>
    I should have thought more about saying this. I just let it out. It was something that would usually be on your mind, but you don't say. It was an option that I had among others. What brought me to saying it, I don't know. That was quite spontanious.
    <span class="thought" *ngIf="showThoughts">I am currently wondering why there is a bottle of soy sauce on the floor next to my chair. And also, I shoudl go sleep now, since its 03:21. Good night, guys...or just myself.</span>
  </p>
  <p>Well, Its me again. Today, its the 13. December 2022. I haven't written here in a while but I wanted to for a while. Everytime I fount time, I probably wasted it on social media. I am currently writing in the web editor of github on my phone, which is cursed. Here are a few things that happemed since last time we saw us: I started learning italian on duilingo, and i really enjoy it ao far. I bouldered 2 7b+ (one of them is a 6c+ in my and Thomas opinion), the other one was actually fkn hard. After the stuff with sinja stopped, things changed. We barely write together and never met , except in Jubla. I think its the smartest thing to do. I'm quite sure sinja didnt get over me yet, but I'll see. I'm looking forwars to discuss thi gs out at some point, and clear things up. I noticed something in the last few weeks. I miss havi g a girmfriend. Especially i want to cuddle aomething at night, for now I'm using orca. Also I feel like I get a crush(whatever that means) on everyone i meet. Like forreal. Examples are, Gabriele (lithuanian friend of thomas), Aline (climbing buddy) and Muriel (jonas friend he, he brought her bouldering a few times). That must be happening because of my urge to have a girlfriend again. Like i reeeally wanna get to know muriel right now. Because ahes the one of the three i met the last lol. And I know her the least. She can climb some 6a's abd 6b's. Got long, really really bright blond hair, is about as big as me and as skinny as me (except my crazy V shape cap)
  </p>
  <p>
    An unsolved mystery for me is Sinja's relation to Leander. Her feelings for him that she was having, had, or has. Like the fuck, Leander told me stuff and showed me stuff I didn't know about. I will try to make a summary of what he told me. Sinja and Leander talked together, after me and her got together. Sinja explained to Leander, that she kind of had feelings for both him and me, at the time when me and her got together. That was already quite weird, like she had the decision of who to take and when I showed up she just accepted that... I don't get it really. After being together with me for 5 months with me, she shouldn't give a single fuck about Leanders feelings for other people, right? I mean she is not supposed to have feelings for him at this point. Well, when Leander came together with Gianna, he told that to Sinja when they walked home together once. As far as I understood it right, Sinja couldn't handle this and got sad... She didn't want Leander to have someone else. Thats weird. Especially because Leander having feelings for Sinja destroyed our whole frinedship. Like when Leander told me he got a girlfriend, I was so happy for him! Also for me, because I thought he was finally done with Sinja. So I really can't understand why in the world she would get jealous of this guy. Leander showed me texts from Sinja where se said stuff like that she had feelings for him and still likes him?? Thats what I have in mind, she didn't say it exactly like this but that's the meaning that I understood from it.<br>
    The week we broke up, Sinja invited Leander over on Tuesday. They almost made out that evening, and Leander told me that she was giving him extremely much body-nearness (whatever this is called) so obviously Leander got hopes about them two. The day we broke up, Leander was invited to Sinja by Alena, but he declined to go there if not Sinja directly asked him. Well, she did, they made out. Sinja, why the fuck? Do you have feelings for Leander? If so, why didn't you ever talk to me? In some way? I would love to hear her opinion about this stuff but I doubt that it's a good idea to talk about everything already. I probably should wait a bit until the whole situation cools down.
  </p>
  <p>Also, I'm crushing even more about Muriel right now. I can't say why this is happeneing, but to be fair this is never the case with such things.  I asked her on insta if whe would come bouldering today, i was excited as fuck, about me writing and aloso about her answering. I usually don't write people I don't know, so this was quite special for me, I guess. Everyone else got sick or is hurt. Thomas got a destroyed finger and knee, I hope it's alright for when we go to Italy. About this, lea successfully did her driving test, so Thomas doesn't have to drive alone. But Lea never drove with a Handgeschalted car before haha so this is going to be a lot of fun! A thing do all the time, is some kind of hoping that someone is watching me, or seeing what I see. Then they see how cool I am. For examle, when I went biking once in 7. Grade, I wished, Frau Frey would see me right now to see how fkn cool I am. I had this with basically everyone, and today it was Muriel. Fuck dude, I don't even know her!
  </p>




  <p>    
    Hello. Now as a disclaimer, this here has nothing to do with the previous entries of this book, I'll look at it more like as a diary. It's the 28 of December, 17:15. I haven't done anything the whole day, and that makes me feel like shit.
    I slept until noon, still missed the lunch somehow, and then I scrolled through social media the whole afternoon. I asked Celine if she was around to do something, but she was away. I'll probably meet her after dinner or for dinner, though.
    I have a big fucking problem. I broke my right little finger last Friday. Every time someone asks me how I managed to do this, I have to laugh, because it's so fucking stupid. We played a ball game called "Bodedüpfis" or "Sitzball". I was standing in a corner, 
    one of our kiddos (I think Valentin, but not too sure) threw a ball at me. As a self defending kind of move, I lifted my left knee and kicked into my right hand. Yep, I broke it completely myself. I'm going to finale ligure for climbing the whole next week which is fucking dumb lol.
    I went bouldering yesterday, and I managed to climb a few routs without the finger hurting, so I'll be alright next week. We planned to go a day earlier than we planned and go to a party in Milano or something. Now, spontaneously Lea and Especially
    Till doesn't want to go anymore. They could at least have told us earlier. It would have been way too cool, in my opinion. Whatever.
    As I said, today I feel like shit. I never had planned as few as in the current holidays. Especially with a broken finger, I can't do shit. Since I started writing here, I feel better, also because of the German banger songs I'm blasting through my room right now.
    Alright, Thomas just called for half an hour and I feel way better now :)
  </p>
  <p>
    Moin. 21.01.23. I feel a bit lonely. We should make a 20 minute presentation fro schol, but Instead I'll go sleep (we havn¨t started yet really). I might have fallen in love with Muriel a bit. Or at least I got a crush. Let's say that's what I assume, because I never really know what I feel. Maybe I'm toootally in love, maybe I just think she's cool. Thats usually how I see my feelings. Right now I know I feel at least something. I'm really excited to meet her again and talk to her. I wanna get to know her better. She's cute as hell!
    And then there's Sinja. I am not at all interested in her anymore. We barely talk and never met except in jubla, since our breakup. Somehow I'm a bit jealous, whoch also botheres me. I know she stressed away after jubla sitzung yesterday and went to Jens, pretty sure she slept there. Made me jealous, I really don't want that. But a reason for it is probably, that Sinja and Jens had something together roughly two weeks before the end of our relationship, even tho nobody knows what it was. I'd be really interested, and I want to talk to her. I don't know if its a good Idea, and I dont want to ask her to talk.
    Yea, life sux. I didn't do shit today, except moving my little finger, since I'm allowed to do that again, finally.
    I wanna hold someone in my arms. Also just laugh and talk and see someone, no matter who. Still, I'll sit home and do nothing all day long tomorrow. I realized that insta and youtube completely suck, yet I can't get away from it. Fuck social medi.
    Oh I almost forgot, last wednesday I asked muriel if she would come bouldering, If I didn't ask, she wouldn't have come. We went there together and I reaaaally enjoyed that time. She's just awesome, idk. Oh and I timed my BeReal purposely to get a picture with her lmao. It worked out perfectly :) She's gorgeous. I'm really hyped for wednesday and hope she comes bouldering. Good night folks
  </p>
  <p>
    I take a sip mate. I drank a lot of mate in the last few weeks. I'm on my phone on the train from Basel to Olten, I was visiting Jael for two hours. With a total of 3 hours travrl, that was totally worth it. I destroyed her like crazy in a game of chess. I told her a lot about my feelings for muriel and also what happened with sinja in the past month - not much. I want to see muriel. I'm thinking about asking her for a spontanious boulder session. I don't seem confident enough to ask her. Maybe we could do something else than bouldering, just meet somewhere, drink something and talk. I hate that humans are some kind of scared of interacting with people they really like but not know yet...cause thats how I feel right now. I don't even know what I'm scared of, lol. Should I just go for it? There would be enough time.
    Latest ond wednesday I want to ask her out or however you want to call this. Ask if she wants to go drink something, or eat at a time. However I really don't want to do that if there's a lot of other guys. Actually if theres any people at all...cause 
    Cause why? Don't fricking ask me. I just wanna sleep lol. So either I go home and clean my room and run to froburg, or I go home and do nothing, or I ask muriel. God, give me a sign. Actually no I dont really care about god, sry bro
  </p>
  <p>
    Ok so, holy shit. Alright so its the same day but now its 22:57. Now take a guess, who just returned from bouldering with Muriel....
    Yup, after thinking about it on my whole way back from Jael, I found my balls again and asked her lol. She said why not, and we went to Lenzburg. That was fun. She's sooo cool! Even as I asked her I already excpected that she wouldn't come, also because it was quite late already so not 100% worth it... Yea I think I learned my lesson. Take a chance or lose it. I took it. And we still got 2 hours of bouldering :) We talked a lot, I really enjoy talking with her. Basically I can relate with everything she sais. Maybe thats also the thing because I just take others opinions and make them my own opinion but we'll ignore that now. Me and Jael (xd) planned that I would like ask her for something like a date, but I didn't. Idk, I didn't feel like it was a good moment. Even tho it probably was one of the better ones, since we usually don't spend time together, with just us two, but whatever. I don't know her for a long time and there's a lot of time left to ask her. I'm looking forward to the moment where Thomas asks me with whom I was bouldering haha, kinda excited to tell him. Because he knows Muriel but probably wouldn't expect that. I mean fair, neither did I. At this point I want to thank Jael, for making me ask her. Thanks smallerThan 4. I write Muriel on Instagram, because I don't have her number. I should have asked her today. Because Instagram sucks, and we both don't use Instagram 24/7. Also she told me, that I was really lucky. Just like me she had set a timer that will close Instagram after 30 minutes, and she already reached those 30 minutes. She decided to add another 10 minutes, that's why she was able to read my message hahaha....I need her number lol. It's way too annoying this way. 
  </p>
  <p>
    So today (the day later) I told Thomas that I went bouldering with Muriel yesterday and he told me, that already last wednesday he suspected, that I might like her a lot. Yea he was right. He said he's gonna ship us, I wish him a lot of luck! Also I told Groudn everything haha, he gave me a lot of tips and stuff but yea idk. He is obsessed of the Idea that I ask her for a date on valentines, but first of all I'm too chicken and second she's in holiday at that time, so yea...Doesn't seem like the masterplan of masterplans to me. gn
  </p>
  <p>Tuesday: my masterplan, tomorrow we all go bouldering like every wednesday. At some point I'm going to tell muriel that starting with next tuesday school ends at 14:00, so I got basically the whole afternoon free. Since this is her birthday, and noone else is around because all her friens are in vacation, its like perfect. Then I be like "oooh what should I do all afternoon.....thats boring lol got nothing to do" and then she's like "eyy wanna do something lol". yep. Since thats not going to happen I would have to add like "we could do something then" but i need to un-chicken myself</p>
  <p>
    The plan almost worked out (its 03.02, 11:07, I'm in home office.). Yup, sadly I didn't ask when we were bouldering. As I think of it now, maybe its better like this. Anyway, yesterday evening I wrote her, If she'd be down to go drink (or something like this) something. Pretty cool huh?
  </p>
  <p>
    I got absolutely friendzoned xd. Yea, life sux. She wrote that she has the feeling, we could get really good friends. I think thats funny haha.
  </p>
  <p>
    She wrote that she enjoys spending time with me, and hopes that it doesn't get weird now...I didn't even consider this happening, that she would friendzone me like this. Its probably better, so I dont build up hopes or something, so thats good. She's just such a cool person, and I still want to get to know her better. I really don't know what to write back, she wrote a shitton. Also she doesn't have anything against the date -> meeting itself, just doesn't want a misunderstanding. Do I still want to go? I don't know...n 
  </p>
  <p>Saturday, 20:24. Today she asked me (for the first time it wasn't me :)) for bouldering, and we went to Isatis in Aarburg. It was very cool, and it wasn't weird at all in my opinion. So the sad part is, that I realized she'd be like the woman of my dreams haha. A little shorter than me, long blonde hair, very very cute, not addicted to phones and stuff, very smart, totally supportable opinions, swiss, likes to boulder, and does it good, likes similar music as me, very open and direct, likes saving money with like migrolino app haha, and so many more. I can't even mention a actually bad thing about her. maybe that she lives in neuendorf, but who gives a fuck! I should stop, she's just a friend hahaha</p>
    
  <p>03.05.2023

    Hallihallo )
I'm back at it again, telling you what i dreamt today. 
It was lovely.
I was actually waiting for something like this.


The first thing I remember, was probably in my garden. I think that Leander, Gianna and Muriel were there. We discussed about buying a domain for our VDINL website, that Shachar made. There were options written, quite big on our housewall. yup. We discussed different providers, also GoMo (since leander is now a client of 'em), even though they don't actually sell domains lol.

Next thing I remember, we're standing in the kitchen. Me next to Muriel. It's dark outside, it's nighttime. There are other people in the kitchen. I don't know who it was. They just stood there. Everything was very calm. It was like it was in slow motion. 
Then, Muriel leaned her head against my shoulder. I took a step closer to her, and for a while we both stood there, side to side. I leaned my head against hers, our bodies toching each others.

and then, then we kissed. It was very soft and shy, only once and short, we looked at each other and then kissed again

  </p>
