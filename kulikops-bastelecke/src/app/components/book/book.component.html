  I just rubbed my eyes like never before. I knew the day would come. I'm sitting in my room, it's 23:54. Almost time, I just realized. Time to change. Now. I changed. 26.11.2022, 23:55:20.

  I really really don't know if this was a good decicion, a bad decicion or both. I definitely changed my life. S esch füf for zwölfi. I take a deep breath and feel the bumpiness of the breath, 
  because I just stopped crying. Quite an interesting thing that I'm doing here. Is it just my typing routine? Me having fun of programming? Or am I actually writing a book, even if it's quite a small one?
  I don't know. But I'm writing it in Visual Studio Code, in the book.component.html file on kulikops-bastelecke website. Random, right?

  Anyways, I should start telling the story now. The first thing I'll write, is the end.

<h2>The end</h2>
<p>Sinja gifted me a day togerther, for my 19. Birthday. Back then we were still together. We both knew that we possible won't be a couple anymore on my birthday, but we agreed to spend this day together no 
  matter what.
